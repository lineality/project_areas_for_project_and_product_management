# project_areas_for_project_and_product_management

"What project areas do you focus on?"

This is more of a brainstorming question that may be useful 
to conversationally start the topic, but it is very important
to not make this a 'telepathy' question where pathologically
expect them to know what you mean by 'project areas'
prior being provided with detailed documentation from you.
This, and questions like this, are generally open ended questions
to try to get a casual sense of what they might be most
interested in and focused on. There is always a chance that
their experience and thinking can be an important new addition
to your tool kit. Others often hold the keys to our locked doors.
